                I was born in <a href = https://www.visittampabay.com/ target = "_blank"> Tampa, Florida</a> on November 13, 1992, but known more commonly to his friends and family as Jay. Jay was born to eleven sibilings including four brother and seven sisters. He moved around quite a bit through his elementary school years attending three schools before passing fifth grade at <i>Oak Park elementary</i>. Jay would then go on to attend <i>Williams Middle Magnet</i>, where he would succesfully complete grades 6th - 8th. Attending high school was the next great adventure on the horizon for Jay, he would attend <a href = https://www.hillsboroughschools.org/middleton target = "_blank"> Middleton High</a> school his freshman year of high school. Before being accepted into Tampa Bay Technical High school for his Sophomore through Senior years. Jay graduated from high in June of 2011 with a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.75.

                Twenty days after graduating from High School Jay enlisted in the <b>United States Navy</b>. Boot Camp took place in <strong>Great Lakes, Illinois</strong>. After graduating from Boot Camp Jay's journey took him to Specialized training <sub>(Where sailors go to learn how to do their selected Militray job)</sub> for IT school in <strong>Pensacola, Florida</strong>. After attending Specialized training for 8 months Jay graduated, and was sent to his first duty station in <i>Sicily, Italy</i>. He would spend three years in Italy from 2012 to 2015, before moving on to his next duty station. In 2015, a new journey would present itself for Jay with him now being stationed in <i>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</i>. That duty station would bring up a lot of important experience, over that three year span. In 2018, Jay would depart Oklahoma for his last active duty stint which would be completed in a small town of <i>Oak Harbor, Washington</i>. About 2 hours north of Seattle. Jay would conclude his Naval career in 2021. Today, Jay is a licensed realtor in Florida.
