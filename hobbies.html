            When I am not spending time as a Realtor, I enjoy a number of different hobbies. Theses activities range from working out all the way up to practicing my coding skills. Please see down below more details about me and what I like to do in my free time:
            </p>

            <h2 id="exercise"> Working out</h2>
            <p class="photo">

                <br>
                This probably my favorite hobby of all the regular hobbies that I do every week. Working out for me proves to be therapeutic. A place where I can escape and either be in deep thought or no thought at all. I generally try to workout 5 days out of the week, for about two and half hours per day. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="fun">Escape Rooms</h2>
            <p class="photo">
                <img src="Escape-rooms.jpg">
                <br>
                Escape rooms are one of my favorite none physical activites. I love how they continually test your mental apptitude under the stress of a 60 minute time clock. They are a lot of fun and if you haven't tried one you should try one soon. They can be a good team building exercise as well in a work setting. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="movies">Watching Movies</h2>
            <p class="photo">
                <img src="movies.jpg">
                <br>
                I know with the phonomenal of having firesticks where people don't like to go to the movies any longer. I am one of those people that still enjoy going to the movies. I get super excited for movie release dates all the time and I try my best to make movie release dates when I can. I may be apart of the growing minority that still like to go to the movie theaters still, but I wouldn't trade it.
